It's a bot for game [Scrap Clicker 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scrap.clicker.android).

It's using 
- ADB for fetching information from the mobile screen (USB connection required)
- HTTP server for proxying view from mobile to OpenCV
- OpenCV for determining what is happening on the screen
- Touchscreen driver for merging elements

**Bot is unusable. Posting it for reference**
